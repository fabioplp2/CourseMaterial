'''
unittest, pytest and doctest are the three major tools for testing in python.
For unittest, the test runner is called
    >>> python -m unittest -v
    >>> python .\test_griddef.py -v
    In order to use doctest, additional code is required
For pytest, the test runner is called
    >>> python -m pytest -v
    To get doc string test using doc test
    >>> python -m pytest --doctest-modules

Note: -v is used to get a list of tests being executed.
